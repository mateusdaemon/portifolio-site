        <p>
            I am a computer engineer and a passionate gamer since my very first "play." This love for gaming led me to start exploring programming during high school. As I delved deeper into technology, I realized I could combine two of my greatest interests: games and programming. When I made that connection in the world of game development, I truly found something special. Today, my goal is to continue growing in this field, creating amazing games and experiences, while having fun and learning along the way. I’m always looking for new challenges to achieve great feats as a developer, and above all, to keep enjoying what I love most.
